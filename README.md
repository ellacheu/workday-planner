# workday-planner

## Description
This workday planner was created for the user to be able to save events into the time slots given.  The events will be saved in their local storage and be presented each time they visit the page.  The current time is displayed at the top and the time slots are highlighted with different colors indicating past, present, and future. Creating this application allowed me to practice using Jquery UI and incorporating Day.js to enhance the overall functionality.  This exercise further allowed me to work through the process of debugging and to have more practice writing functions.
